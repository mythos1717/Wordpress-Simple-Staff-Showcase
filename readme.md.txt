== Description ==

Simple Staff Showcase is a responsive WordPress plugin to showcase your staff or team members. It's simple to use and allows you to display your staff's name, photo, position, phone, fax, email and a comprehensive bio. This plugin is not up on the wordpress plugin database, yet, as it's still in review. I will update this file when it ready to be downloaded.
